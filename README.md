●	Built a Power BI dashboard covering different KPIs (Average revenue per user (ARPU), Churn rate %, and Revenue) to track the 
customer churn rate.


●	The analysis revealed that the total amount of revenue lost amounts to nearly $3 million, with approximately 70% of customers 
lost in the fiber optic internet service.


●	The potential of this dashboard lies in its ability to achieve a 6% churn rate, aligning with the industry standard, while 
simultaneously reducing admin and tech tickets in fiber optic internet service by a significant 60%.
